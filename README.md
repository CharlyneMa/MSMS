# MFT
Simple implementation of matched filter technique
<br>
Procedures: <br>
(1) Selection of template events from initial catalog <br>
(2) Run MFT <br>

## Selection of templates  

(1) Calculate theoretical arrival time <br>
(2) Calculate SNR <br>

<br>
## Run MFT  

(1) Calculate CC trace on every station's record <br>
(2) Mask triggered times with peak CC values <br>
(3) Time shift to original times for all stations <br>
(4) Detect on stacked CC trace
